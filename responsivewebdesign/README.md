Demo for responsive web design
==========

This is the code for Ethan Marcotte's post on [a list apart](http://www.alistpart.com)
named [responsive web design](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design).

A list apart already has the demo hosted [here](http://d.alistapart.com/responsive-web-design/ex/ex-site-mini.html#).
I tried to implement the demo by myself as an exercise.

Images under ``static`` are all from the original demo.
