fixed table column demo
=================
This is my solution to the [question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18826775/fix-columns-in-horizontal-scrolling) on stackoverflow.
The accepted solution is great, however, the head column is fixed in the viewport, which is obviously what the thread starter wants.
However, in my opinion, this is still not the best solution. The best solution is not to use the table at all.
