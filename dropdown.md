Demos for dropdowns
============

dropdown1.html
--------------------
Make the first level "li" horizontal and the second vertical.
The trick is floating all the "li" to the left and setting the same width, 
then the second level "li" could be pushed to nest column.

Try to delete the ``width: 8em;`` line to see the difference. 


dropdown2.html
------------------------
To achieve the same effect as the dropdown1.html by just floating the first level "li".
And I think this trick is much clearer.

Try to delete the ``width: 8em;`` line to see the effect.
