Demos for dropdowns
============

dropdown1.html
--------------------
Make the first level <li> horizontal and the second vertical.
The trick is floating all the <li> to the left and setting the same width, 
then the second level <li> could be pushed to nest column.

Try to delete the ``width: 8em;`` line to see the difference. 


dropdown2.html
------------------------
To achieve the same effect as the dropdown1.html by just floating the first level <li>.
And I think this trick is much clearer.

Try to delete the ``width: 8em;`` line to see the effect.
