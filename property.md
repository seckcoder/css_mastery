Demo for line-height. Russ Weakley has a [presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/maxdesign/line-height) on this.


property-overflow.html
---------------
Overflow is used to specify whether content of a block container element is clipped
when it overflows the element's box.

There is a special property about overflow. When the container element which is overflowed does not
have width/height set, it will try to extend to contain the sub content in width/height. I did not find any resource
talk about why this happened. And this is often used to clear float(search ``overflow clear float``).
